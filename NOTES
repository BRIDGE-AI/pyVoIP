New in v1.0.0:
Originate Calls
Added blocking feature to readAudio, this makes readAudio not return until there is data to be returned.  If blocking is off and data is not available, bytes(length) will be returned.
Now properly generating SIP tags to comply with the RFC.
Other bug fixes

Currently Known Issues:
BYE request on originated calls causes a 500 Error on Asterisk 13 (other versions not tested).  Unsure what causes this, reach out if you have a fix.
Currently does not work with PJSIP (Only tested with Asterisk 18)

Upcoming patches/changes:
Adjust code to be compatible with Asterisk PJSIP.
